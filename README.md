> Writing an implementation of Raft as I read the article and seeing where it brings me

This is a toy experiment that consists in writing a compact and very basic implementation of the Raft protocol as
described in the [Raft Paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf).

This project was part of a "developer book club" activity at Shopify where we explored and discussed about
consensus algorithms.

If you're interested in more serious Python implementations of the Raft algorithm, see for example

* [PySyncObj](https://github.com/bakwc/PySyncObj/tree/master/pysyncobj)
* [raftos](https://github.com/zhebrak/raftos)

or browse the list of implementations for other languages on the [Raft web page](https://raft.github.io/).
